# c4rli++'s Portfolio
A portfolio showcasing my recent projects built using React.js and Bootstrap.

## Description
This repo contains source code for my personal development portfolio built using React.

### My User Story:
```
I want to try a new challenging 'artsy' approach to using the functionalities of React and Bootstrap.
The page will feature a home splash page, a section with my skills, my contact details and previous and future projects.

Must have:
- Navigation using React Router.
- Header
- Home page
- Projects page
- Project (on Projects page)
- Contact page
```

### Features:
- Single page application, loads all content on page launch.
- Renders projects dynamically based on the information in the `projectData.json`
- React Router for easy navigation of pages.
- Responsive for Large Laptop, Tablet and Mobile phone displays.
